					    	Steamize uses the Valve's Steam APIs to retrieve data about the account you've looked up. This account data is only available if you've made your Steam profile public. The JSONs retrieved from the STEAM APIs are manipulated into a structured schema skeleton, which then is stored into a MongoDB database (using MongoHQ as the server). Steamize only stores the required information in the database to decrease the loading time dramatically between each page to ensure user satisfaction.
